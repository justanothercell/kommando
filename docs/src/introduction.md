# Introduction
The kommando programming language pairs a rust-like syntax and the comfort of generics with the simplicity of c.

The first part of the docs is a sequential introduction to the language and the command line tools.

The parts after are itemized lists of features and not meant for sequential reading. Rather use them as a dictionary.
